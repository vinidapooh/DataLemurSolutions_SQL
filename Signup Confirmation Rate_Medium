New TikTok users sign up with their emails, so each signup requires a text confirmation to activate the new user's account.

Write a query to find the confirmation rate of users who confirmed their signups with text messages. Round the result to 2 decimal places.

Assumptions:

A user may fail to confirm several times with text. Once the signup is confirmed for a user, they will not be able to initiate the signup again.
A user may not initiate the signup confirmation process at all.
emails Table:
Column Name	Type
email_id	integer
user_id	integer
signup_date	datetime
emails

Example Input:
email_id	    user_id	      signup_date
 125	          7771	     06/14/2022.00:00:00
 236            6950	     07/01/2022.00:00:00
 433	          1052	     07/09/2022 00:00:00

texts 
Table:
Column Name	Type
text_id	integer
email_id	integer
signup_action	varchar
texts 

Example Input:
text_id	email_id	signup_action
6878	     125	   Confirmed
6920	     236	   Not Confirmed
6994	     236	  Confirmed

Example Output:
confirm_rate
0.67

Explanation
This output indicates that 67% of users have successfully confirmed their signup. The other 33% have either not initiated signup, or their signup is not confirmed yet.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!



My SOLUTION:

with tiktok as(
select e.email_id,e.user_id, t.signup_action,
sum(case when signup_action = 'Confirmed' then 1 else 0 end) as confirmed,
sum(case when signup_action = 'Not Confirmed' then 1 else 0 end) as not_confirmed
from emails as e
join texts as t on t.email_id = e.email_id
group by e.email_id,e.user_id, t.signup_action
)
select round(sum(confirmed)/(sum(confirmed)+sum(not_confirmed)),2) from tiktok
