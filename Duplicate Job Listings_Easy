SOLUTION:


with listjob as(
select company_id,count(company_id) ,description,count(description),
case when count(company_id) > 1 then 'Duplicate' else 'No' end as indicator
from job_listings
group by company_id,description
)

select count(company_id) from listjob
where indicator = 'Duplicate'







SOLUTION IN DATALEMUR

Solution #1: Using CTE

WITH jobs_grouped AS (
  SELECT 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description, 
    COUNT(job_id) AS job_count
  FROM job_listings
  GROUP BY 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) AS co_w_duplicate_jobs
FROM jobs_grouped
WHERE job_count > 1;




Solution #2: Using Subquery
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) AS co_w_duplicate_jobs
FROM (
  SELECT 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description, 
    COUNT(job_id) AS job_count
  FROM job_listings
  GROUP BY 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description) AS jobs_grouped
WHERE job_count > 1;
