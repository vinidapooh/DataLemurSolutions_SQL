Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card, and to gain some context, you are analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.

Write a query that outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in issued amount between the month with the most cards issued, and the least cards issued. Order the results according to the biggest difference.

monthly_cards_issued 

Table:
Column Name	Type
issue_month	integer
issue_year	integer
card_name	string
issued_amount	integer
monthly_cards_issued


Example Input:
card_name	issued_.     amount	 issue_month	issue_year

Chase Sapphire Reserve	175000	    2	      2021
Chase Sapphire Reserve	180000	    3	      2021

Example Output:
card_name	difference
Chase Freedom Flex	15000
Chase Sapphire Reserve	10000

Chase Freedom Flex's best month was 70k cards issued and the worst month was 55k cards, so the difference is 15k cards.

Chase Sapphire Reserveâ€™s best month was 180k cards issued and the worst month was 170k cards, so the difference is 10k cards.
