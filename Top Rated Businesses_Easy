This is the same question as problem #27 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you are given the table below containing information on user reviews. Write a query to obtain the number and percentage of businesses that are top rated. A top-rated busines is defined as one whose reviews contain only 4 or 5 stars.

Output the number of businesses and percentage of top rated businesses rounded to the nearest integer.

Assumption:

Each business has only one review (which is the business' average rating).
P.S. It's an Easy question, so keep your solution simple and short! ðŸ˜‰

reviews Table:
Column Name	Type
business_id	integer
review_id	integer
review_stars	integer
review_date	datetime
reviews 

Example Input:
business_id	review_id	  review_stars	review_date
532          1234	           5	        07/13/2022 12:00:00
824	         1452	           3	        07/13/2022 12:00:00
819	         2341	           5	        07/13/2022 12:00:00
716	         1325	           4	        07/14/2022 12:00:00
423	         1434	           2	        07/14/2022 12:00:00




Example Output:
business_count	top_rated_pct
3	60
Explanation: There are 3 business with the rating at least 4 - business ids 532;819;716. 
The total count of the businesses is 5, resulting in a percentage of 3/5 = 60%.



MY SOLUTION:

with high_rated as(
select business_id,review_stars,count(business_id) as no_of_biz
from reviews
where review_stars > 3
group by business_id,review_stars
)
select count(business_id) as biz_count, round((100.0*count(review_stars)/(select count(review_stars) from reviews)),0)
from high_rated



I used CTE to first shape the data in a way to extract the output and do the calculation
if you don't use multiply by 100, the answer comes as 0. Even if the instructions don't tell you, this is how perc will be calculated.




DATALEMUR SOLUTION:

SELECT 
  COUNT(business_id) AS business_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(business_id)/
    (SELECT COUNT (business_id) FROM reviews),0) AS top_rated_pct
FROM reviews
WHERE review_stars IN (4, 5);
