CVS Health is trying to better understand their pharmacy sales, and how well different products are selling. Each drug can only be produced by one manufacturer.

Write a query to find out which manufacturer is associated with the drugs that were not profitable and how much money CVS lost on these drugs. 

Output the manufacturer, number of drugs and total losses. Total losses should be in absolute value. Display the results with the highest losses on top.

pharmacy_sales Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
units_sold	integer
total_sales	decimal
cogs	decimal
manufacturer	varchar
drug	varchar
pharmacy_sales 

Example Input:
product_id	 units_sold	total_sales	   cogs	      manufacturer 	 drug
156	          89514	  3130097.00	   3427421.73	  Biogen	        Acyclovir
25	          222331	  2753546.00	   2974975.36	  AbbVie	        Lamivudine and Zidovudine
50	           90484	  2521023.73 	  2742445.90	  Eli Lilly	     Dermasorb TA Complete Kit
98	          110746	  813188.82	    140422.87	    Biogen	       Medi-Chord

Example Output:
 manufacturer	 drug_count	  total_loss
  Biogen	          1	      297324.73
  AbbVie	          1	      221429.36
  Eli Lilly     	  1         221422.17
  
  
  


Explanation:
The drugs in the first 3 rows of Example Input table reported losses. Only Medi-Chord drug by Biogen reported a profit, so it's excluded from the result.

Biogen's loss were the highest followed by AbbVie and Eli Lilly


My Solution:

select manufacturer,count(drug),abs(sum(total_sales-cogs)) as loss
from pharmacy_sales
where cogs > total_sales
group by manufacturer
order by loss desc
