This is the same question as problem #6 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you are given the table below containing tweet data. Write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. 
Output the tweet count per user as the bucket, and then the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

tweets Table:
Column Name	Type
tweet_id	integer
user_id	integer
msg	string
tweet_date	timestamp
tweets 

Example Input:
tweet_id	user_id	    msg	                                                          tweet_date
214252	   111.    Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.	12/30/2021 00:00:00
739252	   111	   Despite the constant negative press covfefe	                  01/01/2022 00:00:00
846402	   111	   Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!	          02/14/2022 00:00:00
241425	   254	   If the salary is so competitive why wonâ€™t you tell me what it is?	03/01/2022 00:00:00
231574	   148	   I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed	              03/23/2022 00:00:00


Example Output:
tweet_bucket	users_num
  1	             2
  2	             1


SOLUTION:

with cte as(
select user_id,count(tweet_id) as tweet_bucket
from tweets
where extract(year from tweet_date) = 2022
group by user_id
)

select tweet_bucket, count(user_id) as users_num
from cte
group by tweet_bucket



DATALEMUR SOLUTION : (the Subquery one)

SELECT 
  tweets_num AS tweet_bucket, 
  COUNT(user_id) AS users_num 
FROM (
  SELECT 
    user_id, 
    COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweets_num 
  FROM tweets 
  WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
  GROUP BY user_id) AS total_tweets 
GROUP BY tweets_num;
