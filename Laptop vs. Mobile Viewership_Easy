Assume that you are given the table below containing information on viewership by device type (where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone). Define “mobile” as the sum of tablet and phone viewership numbers. Write a query to compare the viewership on laptops versus mobile devices.

Output the total viewership for laptop and mobile devices in the format of "laptop_views" and "mobile_views".

viewership Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
device_type	string ('laptop', 'tablet', 'phone')
view_time	timestamp
viewership Example Input:

user_id	 device_type	   view_time
123	     tablet	        01/02/2022 00:00:00
125	     laptop 	      01/07/2022 00:00:00
128	     laptop	        02/09/2022 00:00:00
129	     phone	        02/09/2022 00:00:00
145	     tablet	        02/24/2022 00:00:00


Example Output:
laptop_views	mobile_views
    2	              3



*SOLUTION:*

select 
sum(case when device_type = 'laptop' then 1 else 0 end) as laptop_views,
sum(case when device_type != 'laptop' then 1 else 0 end) as mobile_views
from viewership


The only thing I missed out on this was putting the sum bracket from case to the end. If you remove them, you get it column wise.



*DATALEMUR Solution*
To compare the viewership on laptops versus mobile devices, we can use a CASE conditional statement to define the device type according to the question's specifications.

The tablet and phone categories are considered to be the 'mobile' device type and the laptop can be set as its own device type (i.e., 'laptop').

SELECT 
  CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS laptop_views, 
  CASE WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS mobile_views 
FROM viewership;
laptop_views	mobile_views
0	1
1	0
1	0
0	1
0	1
Let us explain how the CASE statement works using the mobile_views field as an example.

When the device is a tablet or a phone, it is assigned the value of 1. Otherwise, it is given the value of 0.
The IN operator after device_type means OR, as in when the device type is a table OR phone, then it is assigned the value of 1.
Next, we calculate the number of viewership for laptops and mobiles. We can do so by applying the SUM function.

Solution:

SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_views, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views 
FROM viewership;
laptop_views	mobile_views
2	3
Ok, timeout guys!
