Assume you have an events table on app analytics. Write a query to get the appâ€™s click-through rate (CTR %) in 2022.
Output the results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0, not 100.
Percentage of click-through rate = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
events 
Table:
Column Name	Type
app_id	integer
event_type	string
timestamp	datetime
events

Example Input:
app_id	event_type	timestamp
123	    impression	07/18/2022 11:36:12
123	    impression	07/18/2022 11:37:12
123.  	click	      07/18/2022 11:37:42
234	    impression	07/18/2022 14:15:12
234	    click	      07/18/2022 14:16:12


Example Output:
app_id	ctr
123	   50.00
234	  100.00




My Solution:
with metric as(
select app_id, 
case when event_type = 'impression' and EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) = 2022 then 1 else 0 end as imp,
case when event_type = 'click' and EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) = 2022 then 1 else 0 end as clicks
from events
)
select app_id, round(100.0*sum(clicks)/sum(imp),2)
from metric
group by app_id

#I had forgotten to filter for the year 2022, as it was asked, so even though I got the CTRs right, my submission was still wrong.
For filtering by year, I chose to use the Extract function, to get the year from the timestamp column.



DATALEMUR

SELECT
  app_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS clicks, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impressions
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' AND timestamp < '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY app_id;
